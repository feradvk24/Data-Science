In order to actually get to the *negative* words, I need to showcase the first **100** just to get words like *disappointed', 'terrible','slow'*. There are a lot of seemingly positive words in the top words for the negative reviews, such as *'good', 'nice', 'like'*, but the words are most likely in combinations like *'not good'*, *'not nice'* etc:"
